# Roadmap

Goal: a tool architects run on CI every day, which they trust because each finding has `file:line` and doc-quote evidence and false positives are rare.

How to use this file: items are in priority order. Status is `done`, `next` (the one to do now), `todo`, `blocked` (with the reason) or `later`. "Do the next step" takes the `next` item; when it is done, mark it `done` with its PR and promote the following item. Each item states when it counts as done.

Success measures: false-positive rate under 10% on pilot repositories; under a minute to act on a finding; fewer `UNVERIFIABLE` relations over time.

## Done

## Open

### 1. Pilot on one of Mic's work repositories (blocked: repository access)

The most important open test: nobody but the author has used the tool on a real project. Mic runs `archdrift init --mode gate` and writes 3–5 rules, or attaches the repository to a session.
Done when: lock reviewed, `check` run, every failing finding graded, false-positive rate recorded here.

### 2. Runtime relations from `.proto` files (next)

Many `UNVERIFIABLE` relations are gRPC calls. Parse `service` definitions in `.proto` files (a small hand-written parser, no dependency) and map generated clients to the serving component, so "A calls B over gRPC" becomes checkable.
Done when: on the Thanos or Cortex pilot, the share of `UNVERIFIABLE` relations drops, with no new false positives in the offline eval.

### 3. Claude GitHub Action for issues (later)

Mic opens an issue and mentions `@claude`, and the action works from `CLAUDE.md` and opens a pull request. Restricted to Mic. Uses the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret, so each run costs tokens. Do it once `CLAUDE.md` has been stable through a few pull requests.

### Later (only when pilots ask for it)

- Other languages behind a `CodeModel` interface (Java/Kotlin, TypeScript, Python).
- docker-compose and Kubernetes manifests (needs YAML, which conflicts with the single-dependency rule).
- Several repositories against one system-level doc.
- Drift over time, per-component owners, periodic reports for an architecture board.
